          <h3>Graham Cracker Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>
          <br>
          <p class="text-left">
            Ingredients</p>
            <ul class="text-left">
            <li>3 cups crushed graham crackers</li>
            <li>1 can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
          <p class="text-left">Directions</p>
          <p class="text-left">Preheat your oven to 385 degrees.  Combine all the ingredients in a bowl.  Scoop onto a baking 
            sheet lined with parchment paper. We use a cookie scoop, but a large spoon works great, too. Bake 
            about 8 minutes. We like our cookies lightly browned on top.</p>

          <p class="text-left">Don‚Äôt be afraid to play around with this recipe! You can substitute a different flavor of chips, 
              add new ingredients (someone on Instagram suggested mini marshmallows), and alter the cooking time 
              to see what you like best. I also want to point out that the dough is 100% edible üôÇ</p>

          <p class="text-left">This recipe has been in my family since my mother was in Elementary school. Here‚Äôs where it came from, 
              as told by my mom: ‚ÄúMany years ago, when I was in 4th grade, I decided to learn to play the flute. In school 
              we had group flute lessons, and this is where I met my friend, Kathy. One day Kathy invited me over to her house 
              after school. We had these super delicious cookies! I asked for the recipe and her mom gave it to me. It‚Äôs 
              been a favorite in our family ever since.‚Äù

          <h3>Homemade French Bread</h3>
          <p class="text-left">
            Ingredients
          </p>
          <ul class="text-left">
            <li>2&1/2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>5 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>6 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon yeast (can use 2 T. if you aren‚Äôt using a breadmaker to mix the dough)</li>
            <li>1 egg white, beaten ‚Äì DON‚ÄôT USE until dough is formed into loaves</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-left">Directions</p>
          <p class="text-left">Mix the ingredients together. If you are using a breadmaker, add the ingredients in the order I‚Äôve listed them. Knead the dough, adding flour 
            as needed to form a stiff (not tacky) dough. Let it rise until doubled. Divide dough into 2 loaves and shape them to look like loaves of french 
            bread. Place the shaped loaves onto a large greased/parchment paper lined cookie sheet. With a sharp knife slice the top of each loaf 3 times 
            diagonally, then brush the tops with your beaten egg white. Allow the loaves to rise until the dough is light. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 
            degrees for about 30 minutes. Don‚Äôt be afraid of browning the tops. (The first time I made this recipe I took the loaves out too soon.)
